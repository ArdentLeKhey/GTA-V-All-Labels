	FMMC_RC_T1 = The Trigger and Lobby Camera are both required to get players into your Race. Now it is time to go to the "Checkpoint" menu and start to create the route for the Race.
	FMMC_RC_T2 = The first checkpoint is the starting grid, where players will start the Race. If the Route Type was set to "Laps" in the Race details, this is also where the Race will end.
	FMMC_RC_T19 = ~a~~n~~n~Set up the Race Details any way you choose. Return to the Main Menu when you are done.
	FMMC_RC_T20 = Every Race needs a Title, a short Description and a Photo. All these options and more are found in the "Race Details" menu.

	FMMC_RC_T24 = Select Trigger from the Menu.
	FMMC_RC_T60 = Set the Trigger location for your Race. The area must be flat and clear. If the location is unsuitable, the marker will turn red.
	FMMC_RC_T61 = Once the Starting Grid has been placed in a valid position, we can start placing the checkpoints. The racers will need to drive close to each checkpoint in the correct order to complete the Race.
	FMMC_RC_T62 = The best Races have Checkpoints that can be seen from the Checkpoint before it. This makes the Race easy to follow and more fun to drive.
	FMMC_RC_T63 = Place some Checkpoints.

	FMMC_RC_T69 = It is best to use a combination of both placement cameras. The Vehicle Camera is good for creating a quick route and the Sky Camera is good for adjusting the positions.
	FMMC_RC_T70 = Place more Checkpoints.

	FMMC_RC_T76 = Then publish the Race so that it is available on the Rockstar Games Social Club and other players from around the world can download and play it.
	FMMC_RC_T80 = Now that the Details are set, we should begin creating the Race. The first stage is the Trigger location, which is where players will join in GTA Online to play the Race. The Trigger is found in the "Placement" menu.
	FMMC_RC_T82 = Each Checkpoint has three respawn positions attached to it and they should be rotated to point in the direction the Race is going. If a player respawns, they will reappear at the last Checkpoint, in one of these positions.
	FMMC_RC_T83 = These positions are shown as the vehicles that follow behind the placement tool. If a position is not valid the vehicle turns red. There must be at least one respawn position per checkpoint.
	FMMC_RC_T84 = If you want to edit or delete a placed Checkpoint, you must select the Checkpoint with the marker then press ~INPUT_FRONTEND_ACCEPT~ to edit or ~INPUT_FRONTEND_X~ to delete.
